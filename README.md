Hi, I'm Dhruv. I'm currently a Pipeline Architect, working on Augmented Reality at <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgovil/dgovil/main/images/apple_logo.svg" width=16 alt="Apple Logo">. I'm also an artist, and previously worked in Visual Effects and Animation as a Pipeline and Layout Supervisor. My skills are a good mix of art and technology, because I like to speed up my content creation workflows.
